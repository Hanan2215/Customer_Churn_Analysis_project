# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn behavior** in a telecom dataset. The goal is to understand **why customers are leaving** and identify the **key factors influencing churn**. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and statistical insights, this project uncovers patterns that businesses can use to **improve customer retention strategies**.

---

## 🔑 Key Objectives

* Explore the dataset and understand customer demographics & services.
* Compare churn rates across different **internet services, senior citizen groups, and tenure levels**.
* Visualize churn distribution using **pie charts, bar charts, and percentages** for better interpretation.
* Derive meaningful insights that can help reduce customer attrition.

---

## 📈 Analysis & Insights

* **Senior Citizens** show higher churn percentages compared to younger customers.
* **DSL and Fiber Internet Services** exhibit different churn behaviors, with **fiber users churning more often**.
* Customers with **shorter tenure** (new customers) are more likely to leave compared to long-term loyal customers.
* Clear differences are observed in churn distribution across various **contract types and services**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib)
* **Jupyter Notebook** for data exploration and visualization

---

## ✅ Outcomes

* Improved understanding of **customer churn factors**.
* Clear, professional **visualizations** to communicate findings.
* A structured approach that can serve as a **baseline for predictive modeling** in future projects.

---

## 🚀 Future Work

* Implement **Machine Learning models** to predict churn probability.
* Conduct deeper feature engineering for customer behavior segmentation.
* Explore retention strategies using **what-if analysis** and simulations.
